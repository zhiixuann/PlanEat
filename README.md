# PlanEat
PlanEat is a meal-planning mobile application tailored to address the dietary 
challenges faced by students at University Sains Malaysia (USM). Nowadays, 
students often struggle to maintain a healthy and balanced diet due to their hectic and 
busy academic schedules. The lack of localized meal options in existing meal
planning applications also further compounded this issue as students find the choices 
offered less relevant. PlanEat aims to bridge this gap by offering more variety of local 
cuisines options for USM students while providing personalized meal plans 
specifically cater to the individual dietary needs and preferences of USM students. 
They will also gain access to health information such as BMR and daily calories 
intake based on their dietary goals.
